# Nimble-Snapshots

## 4.0.1

* Nimble-Snapshots does not call `view?.drawViewHierarchyInRect(bounds, afterScreenUpdates: true)` on your views by default. - @orta

  If this is something that you need in order to get your snapshots passing, you should look at two options:

  - Adding the view to an existing window, then calling `drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:` - this
    is the technique that is used inside `FBSnapshotTestController`, which we now expose as an option in `recordSnapshot`
    and `haveValidSnapshot` as `usesDrawRect`

    ``` swift
        expect(imageView).to( recordSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
        expect(imageView).to( haveValidSnapshot(usesDrawRect: true) )
    ```

    You can get more info on the [technique on this issue](https://github.com/facebook/ios-snapshot-test-case/issues/91) 


  - Spending time looking in how you can remove Async code from your App. Or look for places where you are relying on a view structure
    which isn't set up in your tests. There are a bunch of examples in https://github.com/orta/pragmatic-testing on removing Async.
